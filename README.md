# YouTube Clone

YouTube Clone is a React-based web application that mimics YouTube's interface, featuring data fetched from the YouTube API. It includes a sidebar with necessary buttons, a navbar with a search bar that suggests search items, live chat functionality, and comments. The application utilizes Redux for efficient state management and caching to reduce API calls. The entire project is styled using Tailwind CSS and follows a well-structured folder hierarchy similar to industry standards.
